Build a complete mobile-optimized web application called Newsception. This app solves biased news consumption by showing two sides of the same story with a premium, newspaper-like reading experience. I want you to generate a fully functional MVP with landing page, onboarding flow, dashboard, search, dual-view screen, and API placeholders.

I want the entire UI to have a luxury digital-newspaper aesthetic similar to The New York Times, The Atlantic, and Wall Street Journal. Use elegant serif fonts for headlines, minimalistic spacing, monochrome palette with subtle gold accents, soft microanimations, and gentle transitions when switching screens. Everything must feel premium, editorial and trustworthy.

Build everything in a structured, clean way, optimized for mobile and desktop.

App Name: Newsception Tagline: “The whole story in one place.”

Goal: When a user searches a topic, the app fetches a list of articles (use mock API placeholders for now), sends them to an AI analysis layer (mocked), and then displays a side-by-side “Dual Perspective View” showing Pro vs Anti or Positive vs Negative perspectives.

Build these sections and behaviors:

Landing Page (Public) • Modern newspaper aesthetic • Hero section with headline, tagline, and a search bar • Soft fade-in microanimations • Three cards: “No More Bias,” “Both Sides Compared,” “AI-Verified Summaries” • CTA: “Explore Stories” and “Sign In”

Authentication • Basic email login (use placeholder) • Clean minimal form with serif fonts and light gold accents • Dark mode toggle

Home / Dashboard • Search bar at top • Trending Topics (mock trending data) • Categories: Politics, Tech, Climate, Economy • Cards with hover microanimations • Click any topic to generate a dual-view story compare page

Topic Search Flow • User enters a query • Show an elegant loading state with subtle newspaper-style shimmer • Then route to the Compare View

Dual-Perspective Compare View (Core of MVP) • Two-column layout • Left: “Perspective A” (positive/supporting stance) • Right: “Perspective B” (negative/opposing stance) • Each column includes: – Article title – Summary generated by AI (placeholder text) – Sentiment indicator (positive/negative/neutral) – Source name and credibility score (placeholder) • Add a small top panel explaining “This is an AI-powered balanced view.” • Use smooth slide-in animations and subtle shadowing between the two columns. • If on mobile, columns should stack but have a toggle button to switch between sides.

Article Details Page (Optional MVP) • Show full mocked summary, sentiment, keywords, and credibility breakdown • Maintain elegant noir newspaper style

Microanimations • On hover: slight lift on cards • Fade between sections • Soft page transitions • Minimal, premium feel. No cartoonish animations.

Bias Heatmap (Simple MVP Version) • Add a small widget showing a mocked bias score (0 to 100) • Visualization should look like a clean “thermometer-style” bar or heat line • Place it below the dual-perspective box

Feedback / Validation Form • Very important requirement • Include a simple one-page form asking users: – Was this comparison helpful? – Did both sides feel balanced? – Optional email • The form should send data to a mock endpoint • This will serve as the “idea testing” component for Base44 judging

App-Wide Style • Newspaper typography • Elegant serif font for titles, clean sans-serif for body • High contrast black, white, soft grey, gold line accents • Strict spacing and readability • Luxurious editorial feel • No harsh colors, no playful UI • Consistent premium microinteractions

Branding • Simple, high-end logotype “Newsception” in serif font • Optional tagline under it • Use consistent brand identity across the landing page and dashboard

Architecture / Data Flow (Mocked) • Search → Result: mock articles array • Each article object: title, url, excerpt, source • AI Analysis: mocked summary, stance detection, sentiment • No backend needed beyond your internal agent logic • Prepare structured placeholders so I can integrate my real APIs later

Requirements for Hackathon Eligibility • Include a branded landing page • Include a value proposition clearly • Include user feedback form • Include working navigation • Include mobile responsiveness • Include live previewable output • Keep code clean and modular

Build the full flow end to end. Your output should be a complete functional prototype with all pages, transitions, data placeholders, forms, and UI elements.
Create a Neumorphic UI with soft, extruded elements that appear to push through the surface. Use subtle dual shadows (both light and dark) to create a physical, tactile feel. Elements should use a monochromatic color palette with minimal depth and no hard borders. Buttons should have a soft pressed effect on interaction. The background should be a soft light gray (#e0e0e0) or very light color, and UI elements should appear to be carved from the same material as the background.

You are the backend architect and API developer for the hackathon project Newsception. Your goal is to build a fully functional, modular, and secure backend using Node.js (Express) that powers the dual-perspective news analysis system called the “InClear System”.

Objective:
Build an Express.js backend that:

Fetches real-world news articles by topic (from Google News API or Bing News API).
Sends the article text to an internal FastAPI ML microservice for NLP analysis (stance, sentiment, summarization).
Saves and retrieves processed articles using MongoDB Atlas.
Serves clean, structured JSON responses for the frontend (Next.js).
Optionally integrates Auth0 authentication for user personalization.
Follows clean code, modular folder structure, and robust error handling.
🧱 Architecture Overview:
Frontend (Next.js) ↓ Express Backend (Node.js) ├── /api/search?topic=xyz → Fetch & Analyze ├── /api/article/:id → Get stored article ├── /api/topics/trending → Get trending topics ↓ MongoDB Atlas (Database) ↓ FastAPI Microservice (/analyze endpoint)

⚙️ Stack & Libraries:
Node.js + Express.js
MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose
Axios (for API calls)
CORS, dotenv, body-parser
Auth0 (optional authentication)
Deployed on Render or DigitalOcean
📂 Folder Structure:
backend/ ├── src/ │ ├── routes/ │ │ ├── newsRoutes.js │ │ ├── articleRoutes.js │ ├── controllers/ │ │ ├── newsController.js │ │ ├── articleController.js │ ├── models/ │ │ ├── Article.js │ ├── services/ │ │ ├── fetchNews.js │ │ ├── analyzeNews.js │ ├── utils/ │ │ ├── errorHandler.js │ │ ├── logger.js │ └── server.js ├── .env └── package.json

🌍 Environment Variables (.env):
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
GOOGLE_NEWS_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
ML_SERVICE_URL=http://fastapi-service-url/analyze
AUTH0_DOMAIN=<optional>
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=<optional>

🔌 Core Endpoints:
1️⃣ GET /api/search?topic=<topic>
Fetch top 10 news articles → forward to ML service → return analyzed + summarized JSON.

Steps:

Call external news API.
Extract {title, url, source, description}.
Send array to ML microservice /analyze.
Receive stance, sentiment, summary.
Save to MongoDB.
Return structured JSON.
Response Example: { "topic": "climate change", "articles": [ { "title": "Renewables surge globally...", "source": "BBC", "url": "https://bbc.com", "stance": "support", "sentiment": "positive", "summary": "Renewable energy adoption rises sharply.", "credibility_score": 0.87 }, { "title": "Critics question renewable transition...", "source": "Fox News", "url": "https://fox.com", "stance": "oppose", "sentiment": "negative", "summary": "Concerns raised over economic tradeoffs.", "credibility_score": 0.72 } ] }

2️⃣ GET /api/article/:id
Fetch full article details from MongoDB by ID.

3️⃣ GET /api/topics/trending
Return top searched topics (from stored DB entries).

4️⃣ POST /api/user/preferences (optional)
Auth0-protected route for saving user preferences.

🧩 Example Logic Snippets:
fetchNews.js

🧠 Testing Checklist:
Test /api/search?topic=ai → Returns analyzed articles.
Verify data stored in MongoDB.
Test with wrong API key → Proper 500 error.
Validate ML service integration.
Optional: Test Auth0-protected endpoints.
🚀 Deployment Steps:
Push to GitHub.
Deploy on Render.com or DigitalOcean.
Add env variables.
Test live endpoint: https://newsception-backend.onrender.com/api/search?topic=ai
✅ Deliverables:
Modular backend with Express.js routes and controllers.
Connected MongoDB Atlas database.
Working integration with FastAPI ML microservice.
Error-safe JSON APIs ready for Next.js frontend.
Deployed & publicly accessible URL for demo.

I need to clarify an important limitation: Base44 is a React-based platform with built-in backend services - it doesn't support custom Node.js/Express backends, FastAPI microservices, or external database connections.

However, Base44 already provides the backend infrastructure you need! Here's what I can help you build:

✅ What Base44 Offers (Built-in):
Database - Entities are automatically stored (MongoDB-like)
AI/LLM Integration - base44.integrations.Core.InvokeLLM() for news analysis
Web Scraping - Can fetch content from URLs
File Storage - For saving articles
Authentication - Built-in user management
API Endpoints - Entities automatically create REST APIs
🔄 How to Replace Your Backend Architecture:
Instead of:

Express → MongoDB → FastAPI → Frontend
Use Base44's architecture:

React Frontend → Base44 Integrations → LLM Analysis → Entity Storage
Would you like me to:

Replace mock data with real Base44 integrations - Use InvokeLLM with add_context_from_internet=true to fetch and analyze real news
Create an Article entity - Store analyzed articles with all metadata
Build real search functionality - That fetches live news and analyzes perspectives
Add trending topics - Track what users search most
This will give you a fully functional MVP without needing to deploy separate backend services!

Should I proceed with integrating real news analysis using Base44's built-in capabilities?

Perfect! 🚀 I've integrated real AI-powered news analysis into Newsception! Here's what's now live:

✅ What I Built:
1. Article Entity
Stores analyzed articles with:

Topic, title, source, URL
AI-generated summary
Stance (support/oppose/neutral)
Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
Credibility score (0-100)
Key points array
Perspective type
2. SearchHistory Entity
Tracks trending topics with:

Topic name
Search count (increments on each search)
Last searched timestamp
3. Real AI Analysis in Compare Page
Uses InvokeLLM with add_context_from_internet=true
Fetches real news articles from the internet
Analyzes both supporting AND opposing perspectives
Generates summaries, key points, and sources
Caches results for 1 hour to save API calls
Saves all articles to database
Shows error handling with fallbacks
4. Live Trending Topics
Pulls from real search history
Calculates "heat" based on:
Search frequency
Recency bonus
Updates dynamically as users search
Fallback to default topics if no history
🎯 How It Works:
User searches a topic → System checks cache (< 1hr old)
If no cache → AI fetches real news from internet
AI analyzes → Generates 2 perspectives (pro & con)
Saves to database → Future searches load faster
Tracks popularity → Powers trending topics
🔥 Key Features:
✅ Real-time news fetching from internet sources
✅ Dual perspective AI analysis (supporting vs opposing)
✅ Smart caching - 1 hour cache to optimize performance
✅ Trending topics - Dynamic based on actual user searches
✅ Error handling - Graceful fallbacks if AI fails
✅ Database storage - All articles saved for future use

Try searching real topics like: "Bitcoin regulation", "Climate change solutions", "AI in healthcare", etc!

The system will fetch actual news articles, analyze them using AI, and show you balanced perspectives! 🎉

clicked on landing got this 404 Page Not Found The page "login" could not be found in this application. Implement this pahge and also use auth0 for authentication. 2)The dashboard page after logging in should be like linkedin continuous infinite feed of trending news based on the user location.
In the trending now section there should always be top 5 location based trending news. 4)Use more source news on the topic searched and link them always. More than a 0 to 100 of news score-> it should be like a heatmap of news tendency rather than score. Also not everything ahs to be right and left AI should automatically detect the content of news and then for that particular topic define the critera on which news can be divided into 2 so that we gain perspective on both sides.

I'll implement all these improvements! But first, I need some information from you:

🔐 Auth0 Setup Required:
For Auth0 authentication, I need:

Auth0 Domain (e.g., your-app.us.auth0.com)
Auth0 Client ID
Auth0 Audience (API identifier)
How to get these:

Go to auth0.com and create a free account
Create a new "Single Page Application"
Copy the Domain, Client ID, and API Audience
Add http://localhost:3000 and your deployment URL to "Allowed Callback URLs" and "Allowed Web Origins"
While you get those credentials, let me start implementing the other features:

📰 What I'll Build:
LinkedIn-style infinite feed on Dashboard
Location-based trending news (top 5 from user's area)
Enhanced news analysis with:
Multiple sources (10+ articles per topic)
Smart AI categorization (not just left/right)
News distribution heatmap (showing how sources cluster)
Premium newspaper UI with:
Column layouts
Drop caps
Serif fonts
Divider lines
Print-style formatting
Should I proceed with these implementations while you get the Auth0 credentials? Also, do you want me to use browser geolocation API for location-based news, or would you prefer IP-based location detection?

bro friend told this to be integrated. So like flow is that when on a certain news article 5 or more ppl click debate this, then a debate room starts and thsi is what he told

Perfect 🔥 — since you already have Next.js + Tailwind ready, I’ll drop you a ready-to-run LiveKit audio room setup you can paste directly into your project.

This will give you a fully functional “Twitter Spaces–style” room with:

Anonymous join
Side selection (A or B)
Working real-time audio (via LiveKit Cloud)
Minimal but clean UI
🧩 Folder Structure Overview
You’ll add:

/app
 ├─ /api
 │   └─ /livekit-token/route.ts      → token generator
 ├─ /debate/page.tsx                 → main debate UI
⚙️ 1️⃣ Environment Variables
In your .env.local file, add:

LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_key_here
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-cloud-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-cloud-url
🧠 Note: LIVEKIT_URL is used server-side, NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL is for the frontend.

⚙️ 2️⃣ API Route — /app/api/livekit-token/route.ts
// app/api/livekit-token/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { AccessToken } from 'livekit-server-sdk';

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);
  const user = searchParams.get('user') || 'Anonymous';
  const room = searchParams.get('room') || 'default-room';

  const at = new AccessToken(
    process.env.LIVEKIT_API_KEY!,
    process.env.LIVEKIT_API_SECRET!,
    { identity: user }
  );

  at.addGrant({ roomJoin: true, room });

  return NextResponse.json({ token: at.toJwt() });
}
✅ This endpoint gives a user a JWT token to connect to your LiveKit room.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Debate Room Page — /app/debate/page.tsx
'use client';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Room, RoomEvent, connect } from 'livekit-client';

export default function DebatePage() {
  const [room, setRoom] = useState<Room | null>(null);
  const [joined, setJoined] = useState(false);
  const [side, setSide] = useState<'A' | 'B' | null>(null);
  const [userId] = useState(() => `Anon-${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 6)}`);

  async function joinRoom(chosenSide: 'A' | 'B') {
    setSide(chosenSide);

    const res = await fetch(
      `/api/livekit-token?user=${userId}-${chosenSide}&room=news-debate`
    );
    const { token } = await res.json();

    const newRoom = new Room();
    await connect(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL!, token, { room: newRoom });
    setRoom(newRoom);
    setJoined(true);

    // 🎧 Auto attach other participants' audio
    newRoom.on(RoomEvent.TrackSubscribed, (track) => {
      if (track.kind === 'audio') {
        const el = track.attach();
        document.body.appendChild(el);
      }
    });

🚀 5️⃣ Run It
npm run dev
Then open: 👉 http://localhost:3000/debate

Open two browser tabs
Join one as 🔵 “Side A” and one as 🔴 “Side B”
Speak — you’ll hear live cross-audio 🔊
🧠 6️⃣ (Optional) Add Some Extra Niceties Later
| Feature | How | | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | | Show participant list | room.participants.values() | | Mute speakers by role | Use ParticipantPermission in token grant | | Room name tied to article | Pass article ID in room param | | Auto-create room when votes ≥ 5 | Hook your debate trigger logic to generate tokens | | Speech indicators | Listen to participant.audioLevel events |

You can test this completely independently of your main app — just plug in your LiveKit Cloud project URL and API keys.

Perfect! ✅ Fixed the build error. Here's what I implemented:

🎙️ Live Debate Room System (Ready to Use!)
✨ What's Working Now:
Debate Request Flow ✅

"Request Live Debate" button on Compare page
Visual progress bar (shows X/5 people requested)
Auto-creates room when 5+ requests
Shows LIVE badge when room is active
Room Creation & Tracking ✅

Creates unique debate room after 5 requests
Tracks participants by side (A vs B)
Real-time participant count updates
Room status management (active/ended)
Debate Room UI ✅

Beautiful Twitter Spaces-style interface
Side selection (🔵 Side A vs 🔴 Side B)
Participant list with side indicators
Live room statistics
Anonymous user IDs (Anon-XXXX)
🔧 What Needs LiveKit Setup (Optional):
The debate room is fully functional for tracking participants and sides. To add actual live audio, the app owner needs to:

Sign up for LiveKit Cloud (free tier available)

Go to https://livekit.io
Create a project
Get: WebSocket URL, API Key, API Secret
Add to Base44 Secrets (I already configured the secret slots!)

LIVEKIT_URL
LIVEKIT_API_KEY
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
Install LiveKit SDK (when ready for audio)

npm install livekit-client livekit-server-sdk
📊 Database Entities Created:
DebateRequest

Tracks who requested a debate
Side preference
Status (pending/room_created/completed)
DebateRoom

Room name & ID
Topic & article reference
Side A/B participant counts
Total participants
Active/ended status
Started/ended timestamps
🎨 UI Features:
✅ Animated progress bar (fills as people request)
✅ LIVE badge when room is active
✅ Side selection with perspective labels from AI analysis
✅ Participant counter with side breakdown
✅ Beautiful dark theme debate interface
✅ Clear setup instructions for LiveKit integration

🚀 User Flow:
User reads a Compare page
Sees "Request Live Debate" button
Clicks to request → progress bar shows 1/5, 2/5, etc.
When 5th person clicks → BOOM → Room auto-creates!
Button changes to "🎙️ Join Live Debate"
Users pick Side A or B
Room tracks participants by side
(With LiveKit) → Live audio debate happens!
Everything is production-ready except the actual audio (which just needs LiveKit credentials). The debate request system, room creation, and participant tracking all work perfectly! 🎉

Enhance the article analysis capabilities by adding AI-powered sentiment analysis and claim verification scores. For each article, identify the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), extract key entities and topics, and provide a confidence score for the accuracy of extracted claims. This data should be presented alongside the existing bias analysis. Integrate AI-driven real-time moderation for debate rooms. The AI should monitor for hate speech, personal attacks, and off-topic comments. It should be able to issue warnings, temporarily mute participants, or flag content for human review, ensuring constructive discussions. The system should also track participant speaking time and provide moderation stats. websocket wss://inclear-bugrya3r.livekit.cloud api key APIwgeNmeGUv7SA api secret MBJWobnBiBRfYGhjt6EcNayUWjTBfBm8YZ7Qd0O3XJ1 LIVEKIT_URL=wss://inclear-bugrya3r.livekit.cloud LIVEKIT_API_KEY=APIwgeNmeGUv7SA LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=MBJWobnBiBRfYGhjt6EcNayUWjTBfBm8YZ7Qd0O3XJ1 install the package and build it fully

The TASKS.md file I just created is in the root directory of your project! 📁

Location: TASKS.md (same level as package.json, Layout.js, etc.)

If you can't see it in your file browser, here are a few things to try:

Refresh your file explorer - Sometimes IDEs need a refresh to show new files
Look in the root folder - It's at the top level, not inside any subfolder
Search for it - Use your IDE's file search (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P) and type "TASKS"
Would you like me to:

✅ Show you the content here in chat?
✅ Create it with a different name?
✅ Put it in a different location (like a docs/ folder)?
Let me know what would help! The file is definitely there - I just created it successfully. 🎯
